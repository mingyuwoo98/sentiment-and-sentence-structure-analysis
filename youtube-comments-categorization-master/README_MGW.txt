For the reproducibility paper:
    - requirements_MGW.txt
        - includes packages used to run the respective notebooks. NOTE: not all packages in the original requirements.txt were required so only the necessary ones were used.
    - main_MGW.ipynb and main_using_tfidf_MGW.ipynb
        - edited so that the hyperparameter training can be done nicely (essentially same as original two notebooks)
